Project Status: 
Complete.

Purpose: 
Bootcamp assignment.

Objective:
To apply knowledge of API, AJAX and JSON in creating a web page which allows users to click buttons and display gifs of different subjects. The subject I chose is related to sports.

Guidelines:
An array of strings is utilized to create buttons in HTML, utilizing a loop to append each button.
Each button click will display 10 non-animated gif images from GIPHY API.
Subsequent button click prepends 10 more non-animated gifs to the existing gifs.
The image alternates between animating and non-animating with each click on the gif.
The title and rating of each gif provided by GIPHY API is displayed below the gif.
A user input box allows user to submit additional topics to the array, adding to the selection of buttons displayed in HTML.
